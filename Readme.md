# Physalia courses: Big Data Biogeography

Date & time: February 1st - February 5th

Times (CET):

- 9:00 - 12:00 Exercises (teachers available for questions via slack)

- 13:00 - 17:00 Lectures, demonstrations and group work (synchronous)

Location: on-line

Teachers: Alexander Zizka, German Center for Integrative Biodiversity research & Daniele Silvestro, University of Fribourg, Switzerland

## Important
We will use Slack for most of the communication before and during the course. Please make sure to check the slack channel regularly.

## Before the course

- Create an account at www.gbif.org 

- Create and account at www.iucnredlist.org. On day 4 we will use R to obtain IUCN Red List assessments via an API. If IUCN assessments are of interest for you, and want to do the exercise, please request an iucnredlist API token. You can do so by logging into your account at www.iucnredlist.org, and navigate to API access. *This may take some time, please do it as soon as possible*.

- Install the current version of R and RStudio on your computer

- Read the course literature listed below.

- Please prepare 3 minutes (1 slide) to present yourself and your research. Please make sure to answer the following questions:
  a. Where are you from?
  b. What is your research about?
  d. What are your expectations for this course?

## Objectives
After this course, students will be able to:

1. Obtain and prepare large scale species occurrence records from public databases in R (including data mining, data cleaning and exploration)

2. Apply novel methods for handling and processing ‘big data’ in biogeographic research, including area classification, bioregionalization and automated conservation assessments

3. Reconstruct species ancestral ranges based on species occurrences and phylogenetic trees, using different evolutionary models

4. Understand the potential and caveats of fossil based biogeography, and be familiar with novel methods to estimate ancestral ranges and evolutionary rates from ranges of extinct and extant taxa

## Background
The public availability of large-scale species distribution data has increased drastically over the last ten years. In particular, due to the aggregation of records from museums and herbaria, and citizen science in public databases such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). This is leading to a ‘big data’ revolution in biogeography, which holds an enormous but still poorly explored potential for understanding large scale patterns and drivers of biodiversity in space and time.

## Project assignment
During the course you will analyse a specific dataset. We strongly encourage you to bring your own data (Taxon or region of interest, phylogenetic tree, fossil data), which will give you the opportunity to chose questions and exercises most suitable for your work. If necessary we will provide example data during the course as well.
